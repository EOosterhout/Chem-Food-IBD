# Chem-Food-IBD
This project aims to create a framework that allows us to investigate nutrition with a higher specificity, which enables us to understand better why certain foods and diet patterns are beneficial or detrimental for IBD. 
More specifically, the data obtained from the FFQ is transformed into molecular data, thereby constructing a food component database. 
Using this database an analysis framework is built to extract food components from the FFQ and link these to IBD. 
In order to do this, dietary data from IBD patients and controls, which were previously analyzed at the level of dietary patterns and food groups, will be revisited to gain more insights about the role of specific food components in intestinal complaints and the gut microbiome composition. 
Lastly, influencing factors such as genetics will be used in analysis as well. 
Gaining more knowledge on the role of specific components of food can be implicated to guide more science driven nutritional interventions.
